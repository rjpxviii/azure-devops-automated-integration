# Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline for Web Content

This repository contains a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implementation for web content deployment using Azure DevOps. The pipeline is designed to automate the entire process from code commit to production deployment with proper testing, security checks, and performance monitoring.

## CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

```
[DEVELOPMENT PHASE]
Developer Commit → Pull Request → Code Review & Automated Tests
                                   ↓
[CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION]
                   Build Application
                   ↓
       Unit Tests → Code Analysis → Security Scan → Package Application
                                                   ↓
[DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT]
                   Deploy to Dev → Run Tests → Collect Metrics
                                                   ↓
[STAGING ENVIRONMENT]
                   Deploy to Staging
                   ↓
       E2E Tests → Load Tests → Performance Tests → Manual Approval
                                                   ↓
[PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT]
                   Deploy to Production → Purge CDN → Smoke Tests → Monitoring
```
## Features

- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: Development → Staging → Production
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Bicep templates for Azure resource provisioning
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Unit testing
  - E2E testing with Cypress
  - Performance testing with Artillery
  - Web performance auditing with Lighthouse
- **Quality Gates**:
  - Code quality checks with ESLint
  - Security scanning
  - Performance thresholds
  - Manual approvals for production
- **Containerization**: Docker support for consistent deployments
- **CDN Integration**: Azure CDN for content delivery optimization
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights integration

## Architecture

The pipeline follows the GitOps approach and implements a modern web deployment architecture:

```
[Developer Commit] → [Build & Test] → [Dev Deployment] → [Staging Deployment] → [Production Deployment]
```

### Key Components:

- **Azure Pipelines**: YAML-based build pipeline
- **Azure Release Pipelines**: Multi-environment deployment
- **Azure App Service**: Web application hosting
- **Azure CDN**: Content delivery network
- **Azure Application Insights**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Azure Storage**: Static content hosting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Azure DevOps organization
- Git repository

### Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Azure DevOps**:
   ```bash
   # Install Azure CLI and DevOps extension
   az extension add --name azure-devops
   
   # Login to Azure
   az login
   
   # Set up Azure DevOps project
   az devops project create --name YourProjectName --organization https://dev.azure.com/YourOrg/
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy infrastructure using Bicep
   az deployment group create \
     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --template-file infrastructure.bicep \
     --parameters environmentName=dev
   ```

3. **Set up Pipeline Variables**:
   - Create a variable group called `webapp-variables` in Azure DevOps
   - Add the following variables:
     - `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`
     - `ALERT_ACTION_GROUP_ID`

4. **Configure Azure DevOps Pipeline**:
   - Create a new pipeline using the `azure-pipelines.yml` file
   - Link to your repository

## Pipeline Files

- `azure-pipelines.yml`: Main CI/CD pipeline definition
- `infrastructure.bicep`: Infrastructure as Code for Azure resources
- `Dockerfile`: Application containerization

- `performance-tests/load-test.yml`: Load testing scenarios

## Deployment Stages

### 1. Build and Test
- Checkout code
- Install dependencies
- Run linting and unit tests
- Package application

### 2. Development Deployment
- Deploy to development environment
